## Overview

**Auris** is a browser extension that enhances audio from any tab with professional audio processing tools. Whether you're watching videos, listening to music, or in video calls, Auris helps improve your audio experience with equalizers, volume controls, and spatial effects.

**What Auris can do for you:**
- **Works everywhere**: Compatible with YouTube, Spotify, Netflix, Zoom, and any website with audio
- **Instant enhancement**: Real-time audio processing without delays or interruptions
- **Easy to use**: Simple controls and presets make professional audio tools accessible to everyone
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune settings to match your preferences and hearing needs

Auris is designed to help you get better sound from your browser, whether you want clearer voices in meetings, deeper bass in music, or just need to boost quiet audio.

## Key Features

### **Equalizer**
Fine-tune your audio with a 10-band EQ featuring multiple presets (Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classical, Electronic, Hip-Hop, Vocal) or create your own custom sound profile with precise frequency control from 32Hz to 16kHz.

### **Audio Enhancement**
- **Volume Boost**: Amplify audio up to **800%** beyond your system's maximum volume - perfect for quiet videos and low-volume content
- **Bass Boost**: Enhanced low-frequency response with adjustable intensity - controls sub-bass (20-60Hz) and mid-bass (60-250Hz) separately
- **Voice Clarity**: Intelligent vocal frequency boosting (300Hz-3kHz range) with adjustable strength for clearer speech, podcasts, and vocals

### **Spatial Effects**
- **8D Audio**: Creates immersive orbital sound movement - configure **rotation speed**, **orbit radius**, and **elevation angle** for personalized spatial experience
- **Surround Sound**: Virtual 5.1/7.1 surround from stereo sources - adjust **room size**, **speaker distance**, and **surround intensity**
- **Echo**: Add depth and ambiance - control **delay time** (50-500ms), **feedback amount** (0-95%), and **wet/dry mix** for perfect reverb balance
